Path analysis in R with Lavaan:
Testing indirect and total effects in path analysis 

By Mike Crowson, Ph.D.

September 17, 2019

Overview: In this video, I will demonstrate how to obtain estimates
and tests of indirect effects and total effects when carrying out
path analysis using the Lavaan package. This video is a
continuation from a previous video (found at https://youtu.be/QP-v6RwsZjY)
that covers basic concepts and techniques when running path analysis 
using manifest variables. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Lavaan
model syntax and/or the 'lavaan' function, you may need to review that 
before getting started here. 

A link to the previous video, as well as a .csv file containing the 
data and this text file (containing the syntax I review) will be provided
underneath the video description. 

--------------------------------
*The model is specified in exactly the same fashion as in the previous 
video. However, I am now including labels for paths and code for calculating
indirect and total effects.

library(lavaan)
processdata<-read.csv("path analysis dataN BinW.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")

#model specification

model<-'
#labeling path from mastery to interest
interest~a*mastery+perfgoal+ses
#labeling path from interest to achieve. Adding labeled path from
#mastery to achieve
achieve~e*anxiety+b*interest+c*mastery
#predicting anxiety and labeling path from mastery
anxiety~perfgoal+d*mastery
#estimtating the variances and covariances of the exogenous 
#variables (ses, mastery,performance)
mastery~~mastery
perfgoal~~perfgoal
ses~~ses
mastery~~perfgoal+ses
perfgoal~~ses
#estimating the variances of residuals for endogenous variables 
#(interest, anxiety, achieve)
interest~~interest
anxiety~~anxiety
achieve~~achieve
#estimating the covariance of residuals for interest and anxiety
interest~~anxiety
#calculating specific indirect effect of mastery on achieve via interest
SIE1:=a*b
#calculating specific indirect effect of mastery on achieve via anxiety
SIE2:=d*e
#calculating total indirect effect of mastery on achievement via mediators
TIE:=SIE1+SIE2
#calculating total effect of mastery on achieve
TE:=TIE+c'

#using naive bootstrap to obtain standard errors
fit<-lavaan(model,data=processdata,se="bootstrap")
summary(fit,fit.measures=TRUE)

#using 'parameterEstimates' function will give us confidence intervals based
#on naive bootstrap. A standard approach to testing indirect effects.
